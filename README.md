This Repository contains all my front-end practice projects which I build while learning or building expertise in it.

--------------------------------------------------
**1) Game Instructions: "Don't Roll 1"**

Welcome to the "Don't Roll 1" game! Test your luck and strategy as you compete to reach a score of 100 points before your opponent.

**Objective:**
- The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 points.

**Rules:**
1. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
2. On your turn, roll the die to accumulate points. The number rolled on the die is added to your current turn's score.
3. Be cautious! If you roll a 1, your current turn's score becomes 0, and it's the next player's turn.
4. To secure your points, you can choose to "Hold" instead of rolling again. Your turn ends, and your accumulated points are added to your total score.
5. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.

**Strategy:**
- Balance risk and reward. Decide whether to continue rolling to accumulate more points or play it safe by holding your current score.
- Keep a close eye on your opponent's score. Timing your "Hold" decision is crucial to stay ahead.

**Winning:**
- The player who reaches 100 points or more first is declared the winner.

"Don't Roll 1" is a thrilling game of chance and strategy. Enjoy the excitement, but watch out for those pesky ones! Good luck, and may the best roller win!
